## Features
- Addition: Perform addition of two numbers.
- Subtraction: Perform subtraction of two numbers.
- Multiplication: Perform multiplication of two numbers.
- Division: Perform division of two numbers.
- Unary Operations: Perform unary operations like negation and percentage.
- User Interface: The calculator has a user-friendly interface created using Qt's UI design tools.
## Running the Application
The calculator application is already built, and the executable file is included in the project folder. Follow these steps to run the calculator application:
1. Navigate to the project folder where you cloned the repository.
2. Locate the executable file named calculator.exe.
3. Double-click on the calculator.exe file to launch the calculator application.
4. The calculator window will appear on the screen, displaying the numeric keypad and arithmetic operation buttons.
5. Use the numeric keypad to enter the desired numbers for calculations.
6. Click on the arithmetic operation buttons (+, -, *, /) to perform the corresponding operation on the entered numbers.
7. To perform unary operations, click on the respective buttons (+/-, %).
8. The result of the calculation will be displayed in the calculator window.
9. To clear the calculator and start a new calculation, click on the clear (C) button.
### NOTE
To ensure compatibility and successful execution on macOS and Linux, you may need to:
- Install the necessary dependencies: Qt framework, Qt Creator (IDE), and any additional libraries or packages required by the calculator application.
- Modify the project configuration: Make any required adjustments to the project settings, such as paths, compiler options, or environment variables, to match the target platform (macOS or Linux).
- Build the application: Use the appropriate build tools and commands to compile the code and generate the executable file for the target platform.
- Test the application: Run the compiled executable on macOS or Linux to verify its functionality and ensure it performs as expected.
